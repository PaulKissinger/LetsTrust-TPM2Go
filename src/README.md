# LetsTrust-TPM2Go reset toggle

This folder contains the sources necessary to toggle the hardware reset line on a LetsTrust-TPM2Go USB-Stick.

Occasionally, it may be necessary to hardware reset a TPM.
LetsTrust-TPM2Go Reset, or LTT2G RST for short, will execute this reset pulse across the USB-SPI bridge using the libusb-1.0 library.


## 1.1 Prerequisistes

GCC, libusb-1.0, and a LetsTrust-TPM2Go are required to build the ltt2g rst.

This has not been tested, but LTT2G RST may run on many other little-endian hardware and software configurations capable of running Linux with the libusb-1.0.


## 1.2 Starting Out

LetsTrust-TPM2Go USB-Sticks are available for purchase at [buyzero.de Webshop] (www.buyzero.de).

Before you can execute LTT2G RST, you must compile it:
1. Navigate to the folder containing the LTT2G RST source code
2. Type the command below to compile the source code:
make

Remember that this tool works without root! Please use this resource as a guide or for testing.
